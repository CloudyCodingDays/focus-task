## Why yet another todo app?

Honestly, this space is crowded with great apps that cover just about every niche in my opinion. I am an extremely distracted person so I wanted something that would only focus on one task at a time and hide the rest while I am doing one. That is it. 

I started this project to reinforce or try out concepts I was learning at the time like how to use react query caching and data-fetching or how to use react Hook forms and so on. Then it slowly turned into this project with no pre-planning or design so things were kinda figured out as I went along.

## Functions of the App

- Active task Page where nothing else will be on the page for distraction reasons
- Manage Task Page where you can add, edit, view or delete tasks.
    - Tasks can be grouped, sorted and ordered however you like.
- Settings page to change default values for new task and change email and/or password
- Random Cat picture on task completion. I love Cats.
- Account system to keep task information saved in Supabase database no matter what device used.

## Things I want to add in the future

- Zod form validation
- Better themes and proper Dark mode theme
- Reports page to show stats on how fast tasks were completed, how much were completed each day etc.
- ...More to come as I think of it.
